About The Mod
=
Translation: Dragon Rider Mod

This Mod is based of The Inheritance Cycle (Better known as the Eragon Series), and allows you to ride your own Dragon!

It will be adding different colored dragons, with different models and abilities. Along with this will be a Dragon Riders sword you can make (With difficulty) and maybe even meet Eragon himself!
